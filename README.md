# Ray Tracing in WebGL
A little project in WebGL. This project is heavily inspired by Sebastian Lague's _Coding Adventure: Ray Tracing_ video.

## Build instruction
1. Install the required packages from the `package.json`. Here I'm using PNPM but
I reckon it would work elsewhere.
2. Build using `npm run build` or `pnpm build`. You can optionally add `--watch` argument if you want it to watch your program.
3. Open `index.html`. No server is needed.

## Issues
1. The longer you render something, the brighter it is.
